            The members of Trash Can have not often been publicly profiled, in fact this is most likely the first time
            ever that these characters have ever been viewed on a worldwide scale. You must remember that while you are
            reading this the people you are seeing are actual people and the events described in their profiles actually
            occurred. (Why would I lie?) But without further delays I present you with:

        <p>
            The young guitarist/bassist in our band known under the alias of Timothy James Robertson is a boy if very
            mysterious nature. Tim has had a tragic past in which he was born and graced the world with his cries of
            agony and terror (or rather the doctors). Tim is currently 16 years old and resides in the township of
            Osgoode (that's in Ontario). His talents consist of the ability to play both the guitar and bass with
            amazing talent and to sing songs of no particular origin with lyrics that would make Boris Yeltsin crack up.
            Although sometimes he wishes he was of Russian background, Tim resorts to talking in a mock-russian-accent
            in the hopes that he will someday join the Russian Army as a "Commandier". Tim's future obviously holds much
            potential (as you can tell by the expression on his face) and he hopes to launch a company called ROBERTSON
            EFFECTS LIMITED in September of the year 2005. He is a cool guy and definitely an asset to our band. <br />

            The man you see here is another member of our band who lives with his siblings under the assumed identity of
            Christiaan Ian Anderson. (Sometimes he wishes his first name was Hans). Interestingly enough Chris (for
            short) is 17 years of age and is the only person in our band with his driver's license. Chris plays the bass
            and the guitar as well (him and Tim switch for different songs) and writes many of the songs that our band
            plays. He lives also in the region of Osgoode Ontario (in Canada of course) and attends Osgoode Township
            High School with Timothy and David. He is currently not employed but wishes to do something when he gets out
            of school (preferably get a job). For now Chris keeps on playin' along with the members of the band known as
            TRASH CAN and often rambles randomly about how he wants us to "be quiet" (that's quite an understatement).
            He has been often known to repeat the phrase "Oh my goooodness!!!!!" and hopes to remain in the band until
            we all croak. Another cool guy who likes to play music and who has a lot of talent. I give him an 8.5 out of
            10 on the rating scale!

            Jeremy is one of those guys who loves to play (or wail) on his "AXE". This picture of our esteemed friend is
            before his haircut during the summer of 1997 when we were playing a show at the Osgoode Community Center
            with "THE FISH OUT OF WATER". He is the kind of guy who likes to make jokes all the time and play his guitar
            with amazing speed. He is the most avid VAN HALEN fan I know and also loves ELVIS with a passion. (well
            maybe not that much). Jeremy and Tim have been friends since they were really little (actually when Tim
            first moved to Osgoode Jeremy attacked him with garden tools to "welcome" him). Jeremy plays lead guitar in
            our band, and before I arrived he had the honor of playing drums as well (percussionists rule!!!!). He is an
            amazing guitarist who likes to try to solo like Eddie Van Halen, and he has an appreciation for all types of
            music ranging from blues, to rock, to punk, to metal (but NO COUNTRY!!!!). He is currently 16 years old (his
            birthday was January 8, 1998). A really cool guy who plays an amazing lead guitar (check out our sound
            clips!!!!)

            I'm not gonna right too much about myself, cause I'm not all that interesting, but I am the percussional
            experimentalism (drummer) for TRASH CAN. I'm 6 feet tall and like to play drums, guitar, piano, and
            basketball. I attend Osgoode Township High School in Grade 11. As the newest member to the band (I moved
            here in '95) I am often the butt of everyone's jokes, but being in a band is really cool so I don't mind. If
            you ever come to Osgoode you can find me dirt biking in the summer and making snow forts in the winter. A
            cool guy who plays the drums.
