            Hello and welcome to my personal profile page. My name is David Andrew Mosher and I am 17 years old (as of
            Feb. 15/98). I live in Osgoode Ontario Canada and I like sports, computers, playing music and drawing stuff.
            This is a picture I got taken of me in my Communications Technology class with a digital camera. Not bad
            quality huh? Well basically the purpose of this part of my page is to provide some information about who the
            designer/creator of this page is. I really like to make stuff, and this web page is only my second big one.
            If you've ever visited my old site before you probably noticed how it wasn't very good. Well hopefully this
            one is an improvement on the last one, and I hope that you like it. My main interests in school lie in
            Computer Sciences/Animation, Physical Education, Music, and Art. I hope to study computer engineering or
            animation after high school, and take up a job at a company like Industrial Light & Magic or some other
            special effects company. I have 3 siblings in my family, 2 brothers and 1 sister. Well that's pretty much
            all I have to say for now, this page probably won't get any big updates unless I break my arm or something
            so once you read it that's all you'll really have to. Thanks for reading this.
        </p>
