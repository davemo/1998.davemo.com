                We don't believe in stealing other bands songs and stuff so we would appreciate it very much if you did
                not take these lyrics to use in any way other than they are presented here. This means you can copy the
                lyrics, but not if you want to use them to write your own songs with or pass them off with. Of course
                there's not really anything I can do if you do do this but I'm a trusting guy so I'll put you on your
                honor not to take the lyrics to use for the ways listed above. Thanks.</font

            When i wuz in nursery school <br />They took away the finger-paint because it tasted so great <br />They
            replaced it with chocolate pudding, <br />Oh, well, al least that's what they told us.

        <p>Chorus: BEER! I hate BEER! It's such a waste.</p>

        <p>
            From what i've learned through traveling the world <br />Is that nothing really happens it's all just for
            effect. <br />Nothing important ever has to be done <br />As long as there's an easy way to cover it up.
