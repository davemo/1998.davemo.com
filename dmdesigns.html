        <p>
            DM DESIGNS LTD is a fictitious company that I have made up. Basically it's my way of expressing my
            creativity and it's fun to put the logo on things that I have made. My company specializes in basically any
            kind of graphic designing (except 3D modeling 'cause I can't afford the $4000 for 3D Studio Max) and I like
            to make all sorts of things. From web page animation's to simple graphics or complex animation's I like to
            do those kinds of things. I'm really interested in computer animating and 3D modeling (which is what I hope
            to do after High School) and people like George Lucas of Lucas Arts Entertainment, and the programmers there
            are my hero's. Industrial Light & Magic is an amazing special effects company and the things they can do
            amaze me. This page is here just so you know this is my fictitious company, but that doesn't mean I don't
            want to designs something for you. If you have some graphic or animation you want me to make just e-mail me
            and I'll see what I can do. Thanks for reading this!! (E-Mail me!!!)

        <p>
            This page contains a few things that I have made myself, and although some people would rather use these
            creations to pass of as their own, I would appreciate it if they didn't. I don't mind if you use any of the
            animation's on this page but please don't change anything that I have made. Thanks for your co-operation.
            <br />

            <img src="img/trashcananimation.gif" height="50" width="150" align="LEFT" />This animation is just one that
            I made using Adobe Photoshop 4.0.1. These kind are pretty easy to make and I wouldn't call it anything
            special. (I just used the lens flare and linked the frames with Gif Construction Set) <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="img/geocitieslogo.gif" height="100" width="200" align="LEFT" />This is just a geocities animation
            that I made that runs really fast. As you can see I'm kind of a 2D animator 'cause I don't really have a
            good 3D animation program. I'm just kind of an amateur at this stuff but I am capable of better animation's
            and hopefully in the future I'll have some cooler ones. <br />
        </p>

        <p>
            <br /><img src="img/olddaveheader.gif" height="100" width="500" align="LEFT" />This is one of the
            animation's that was on my old page. It's kind of primitive, but I did it using Corel Photo Paint so it took
            a while. I think it's all right.

            The rest of these are just some animation's that I think are cool so I put them on this page. Feel free to
            use them if you want. I will be continuously updating this page so watch for new cool animation's, and if
            you think that you have a cool animation you want me to put on my page, e-mail it to me at the address
            below.
