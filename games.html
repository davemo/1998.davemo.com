                As most computer owner's I too am a game player, although not as hard-core as some people might think. I
                do have a few of the newer games that have been released like Jedi Knight and Tomb Raider, but I'm not
                one of those hard-core gamers who buys 25 games a year. I like to play on the internet a little bit at
                such sites like Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone, and modem games are cool too. I like computers for
                their wide range of uses, and I use mine for everything from Desktop publishing to animation, to word
                processing and games. I hope you enjoy this part of my site on GAMES and maybe learn something. If
                anyone knows how to answer any of the questions that I post on this page please email me!!!! and tell me
                the answer. Thanks.

                The Lucas arts entertainment company is an amazing company (in my opinion of course) and they have such
                games to their credit as Jedi Knight, Dark Forces, Full Throttle, and Afterlife. The creator of STAR
                WARS, George Lucas, is one of the most talented minds of this era and I believe him to be one of the
                best movie makers of the time. His special effects company, INDUSTRIAL LIGHT & MAGIC, is one of the most
                renowned companies of its time. I own a few Lucas arts games including Jeddah Knight, and Dark Forces.
                Jedi Knight is an amazing game that is true 3D and adds another dimension to the Star Wars universe that
                is truly amazing.

                Jedi Knight is the sequel to the original Dark Forces which came out about 2 years ago. It is an amazing
                sequel with 21 massive levels all rendered in true 3D. The uniqueness of this game is unrivaled in he
                fact that it incorporates the use of the light saber weapon from Star Wars, a first in 3D action games.
                It took me about 3 weeks to beat the games 21 levels, but mind you that was on the light side of the
                force, I have yet to beat the game on the dark side. The game gives you the option of pursuing a life on
                either the light or the dark side at about level 14 of the game. Both sides have advantages and
                disadvantages (but personally I like the dark side better; it has way cooler force powers to use). In
                the game you can also use a variety of Jedi Force Powers depending on which path you use. I would
                definitely recommend this game to anyone considering it has amazing graphics and awesome game play. It
                sells for about $55 to 65$ Canadian. Check it out.

                Westwood studios is another dedicated gaming company that has recently been receiving a lot of attention
                for its newest games Blade Runner and Lands of Lore. Although I don't own any of these games I have
                heard great things about them. The games that Westwood is most famous for are Command & Conquer, and
                Command & Conquer: Red Alert. Both of these strategy/war games set the standard in war simulations in
                the gaming world, and they are both really amazing games.

        Command and Conquer: Red Alert is a strategy/action game that lets the player compete in real time with other
        players over the internet or modem, or play against some of the best AI players in multiplayer skirmish's. As
        the commander of an entire battalion of land, air and sea vehicles as well as some pretty cool futuristic units.
        The game play for this game is really well done (you use the mouse most of the game) and I believe that it will
        run fairly smoothly even on a 486 DX/66 with 16 megs of RAM. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes war
        simulations and blowing things up!!!! <br />
